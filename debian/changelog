cocaine-core (0.10.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 10.5.
  * Cocaine is no longer standalone. Multiple nodes can be linked together to
    form a cloud, at last. For now, nodes share services only, apps are still
    local. When an app requests a service which is not available locally, a
    request is made to resolve the specified service remotely.
  * ZeroMQ has gone completely.
  * Bugfix: engines will now try to rebalance when the last slave dies and
    there're still sessions in the queue.
  * Bugfix: engines will now display the reason for app stop in the log.

cocaine-core (0.10.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 10.4.
  * Slave output capturing. When a slave crashes, its stdout and stderr output
    is stored into the designated system storage for future inspection.
  * Storage API v2. The list() method was superseded by the find() method,
    which supports tags and indexing. New blobs can be tagged via a new
    parameter to write().
  * Bugfix: if a slave decide to die (because of an unrecoverable error, for
    example), then detach every session assigned to it before death.

cocaine-core (0.10.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 10.3.

    completion even if the method does not return anything.
  * Optional method parameters.
  * Bugfix: quick exit is used under all circumstances in the process isolate.
  * Bugfix: lock encoder early, render output buffer corruption impossible.
  * Bugfix: cocaine-tool can handle uploads larger than 640KB.

    applications are often re-uploaded.
  * Bugfix: do not die if the application cannot be initialized because the
    engine's listening socket binding has failed.
  * Bugfix: properly handle situations when the specified worker binary cannot
    be executed.
  * Bugfix: explicitly request the signalfd support in libev.
  * Bugfix: gently handle dying workers with sessions.
