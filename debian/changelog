cocaine-core (0.12.1.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: fixed deadlock when unable to spawn a worker in a blocking way.
    When unable to spawn more slaves, a spawning state invokes the slave termination, which in its
    turn invokes self erasing from the pool. This requires acquiring a lock, so these operations
    mustn't be processed in a sequence. One of the solutions is just to delay slave shutdown
    operation. The second one is to use slave GC instead of cleanup callbacks. The third one is to
    delay cleanup operation in the overseer.
    This time we chose the first solution, cause it's the fastest way to fix this behavior, but it
    leads to an infinite spinning until slave spawn.

cocaine-core (0.12.1.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: fixed packing typelists with implicit convertions.
    These changes may affect clients which depend on packing typelists using
    implicit conversion rules; error codes, for example. If you depend from
    typelist packing for types other than error codes, it's highly recommended
    to recompile your services, cause these symbols may be inlined into the code
    giving some weird protocol mismatch errors.

cocaine-core (0.12.0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 12.0.
  * Multithreaded Actor I/O. All incoming messages are now dispatched on a
    shared thread pool, which greatly speeds the things up.
  * Protocol transitions. Service protocols can now specify state transitions
    to support dispatch hierarchies. For example, storage protocol can
    implement a write_stream() method, which switches to stream protocol on
    invocation, or Chrono Service can implement a cancellable_timeout() method
    by switching to a cancellable protocol.
  * App streaming interface. Clients can stream data chunks into the app now,
    as opposed to sending a single request chunk along with the enqueue()
    method invocation.
  * Dropped libev in favor of Boost.ASIO.
  * Logging in now handled via the Blackhole logging library.
  * Locator is now a proper service, without any special treatment. Local
    service management is a responsibility of the Context.
  * Configurable cluster discovery mechanics, including multicast and predefine
    cluster discovery plugins.
  * Routing groups re-implemented using Ketama consistent hashing continuums.

cocaine-core (0.10.5.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 10.5.
  * ZeroMQ has gone completely.
  * Cocaine is no longer standalone. Multiple nodes can be linked together to
    form a cloud, at last. When an app requests a service which is not local,
    a request is made to resolve the specified service remotely.
  * Apps are now exposed as services by default. If a specific application
    should not be published, set the 'local' flag in the manifest.
  * Named queues. Drivers can now enqueue their sessions to a specific worker
    with some human-readable name. The sessions in named queues will be pumped
    before any anonymous sessions in the engine's shared queue.
  * The Locator can now be bound to a configurable port, allowing users to get
    multiple Runtimes on a single host.

  * Storage API v2. The list() method was superseded by the find() method,
    which supports tags and indexing. New blobs can be tagged via a new
    parameter to write().
