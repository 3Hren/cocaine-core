cocaine-core (0.12.0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 12.0.
  * Multithreaded Actor I/O. All incoming messages are now dispatched on a
    shared thread pool, which greatly speeds the things up.
  * Protocol transitions. Service protocols can now specify state transitions
    to support dispatch hierarchies. For example, storage protocol can
    implement a write_stream() method, which switches to stream protocol on
    invocation, or Chrono Service can implement a cancellable_timeout() method
    by switching to a cancellable protocol.
  * App streaming interface. Clients can stream data chunks into the app now,
    as opposed to sending a single request chunk along with the enqueue()
    method invocation.
  * Dropped libev in favor of Boost.ASIO.
  * Logging in now handled via the Blackhole logging library.
  * Locator is now a proper service, without any special treatment. Local
    service management is a responsibility of the Context.
  * Configurable cluster discovery mechanics, including multicast and predefine
    cluster discovery plugins.
  * Routing groups re-implemented using Ketama consistent hashing continuums.

cocaine-core (0.11.0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 11.0.
  * Docker (http://docker.io) containerization support.
  * Routing groups. An ability to route requests to multiple versions of the
    same app based on weights and other metrics.
  * Memory usage reports available from the Locator via the 'reports' method.
  * Break Native Framework binary dependency on Core libraries.

cocaine-core (0.10.6.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 10.6.
  * IPv6 support. Now it is possible to specify an endpoint to bind services
    and the service locator to. This endpoint can be an IPv6 endpoint as well.
  * Bugfix: properly destroy shared channels in actors.

cocaine-core (0.10.5.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 10.5.
  * ZeroMQ has gone completely.
  * Cocaine is no longer standalone. Multiple nodes can be linked together to
    form a cloud, at last. When an app requests a service which is not local,
    a request is made to resolve the specified service remotely.
  * Apps are now exposed as services by default. If a specific application
    should not be published, set the 'local' flag in the manifest.
  * Named queues. Drivers can now enqueue their sessions to a specific worker
    with some human-readable name. The sessions in named queues will be pumped
    before any anonymous sessions in the engine's shared queue.
  * The Locator can now be bound to a configurable port, allowing users to get
    multiple Runtimes on a single host.

cocaine-core (0.10.4.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 10.4.
  * Slave output capturing. When a slave crashes, its stdout and stderr output
    is stored into the designated system storage for future inspection.
  * Storage API v2. The list() method was superseded by the find() method,
    which supports tags and indexing. New blobs can be tagged via a new
    parameter to write().

cocaine-core (0.10.3.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 10.3.
  * Deferred void functions. Allow services to signal asynchronous method
    completion even if the method does not return anything.
  * Optional method parameters.

  * Release 10.2.
  * Service-based tools, rewritten in Python.
  * Chrono and Filesystem drivers are merged into the core.

  * Streaming API.
  * Service protocol inheritance.
